This is for\u00a0me.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Milan, Italy</strong></p>\n<p>I sit in the bus. Still slightly buzzed from the Scottish liquor I had chugged down the night\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>I have to reach the airport in an hour and I have no idea which terminal I need to be\u00a0at.</p>\n<p>But I feel so good, this day marks my first ever day travelling solo, and my mouth is stretched upwards into a weird\u00a0smile.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no one beside me, I\u2019m in the bus early. But I hope no one sits next to me because I\u2019ve got this huge fucking backpack that I\u2019ve got resting on my\u00a0lap.</p>\n<p>The bag is too big to fit in the leg space in front of my seat so I have no choice but to put it on my lap, and I wouldn\u2019t put the bag beside me of course, because that would block a seat and I\u2019m supposed to be a nice\u00a0guy.</p>\n<p>Another passenger hops onto the bus and takes a seat parallel to mine. There\u2019s no one sitting beside her. She looks towards me and smiles politely, I smile back politely\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>I look around the bus, no one seems particularly interested in making conversation. So, I take out my trusted Mi earphones and plug them in. My favourite song is Odesza\u2019s \u2018A moment apart\u2019, it was the intro of an RSD video that I thought was really inspiring.</p>\n<p>I drift into the music, and what would seem ordinary, now looks more interesting that I\u2019ve got a beat going on in my\u00a0head.</p>\n<p>The girl parallel to me is eating a chocolate now, it seems like a fancy brand of some sort, because the chocolate has one of those long wide wrappers that you have to pull down before breaking off a thin\u00a0piece.</p>\n<p>I smile at her politely, I swear this is completely platonic, I can\u2019t stop myself from smiling when I meet someone\u2019s eye. It would be rude not\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>She offers me a chocolate. I say\u00a0sure.</p>\n<p>I eat the chocolate and ask her where she\u2019s\u00a0headed.</p>\n<p>She says that she\u2019s taking a flight to Colombia.</p>\n<p>The name of the country spurs me into a conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cColombia huh? That\u2019s cool. El plata or el pomo,\u201d I say and wink at her, making a gun with my hands and pointing it at\u00a0her.</p>\n<p>She laughs. I don\u2019t blame her. I think it\u2019s a great conversation starter.</p>\n<p>I tell her that I\u2019m going to Barcelona. And that I had just come from Switzerland after doing paragliding.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t understand what paragliding is apparently, because her face shows no recognition of sort. So I notion. I prop up my knee and run my fingers off it, then I gesture with my hands, extending them wide and swaying them as if to say I\u2019m\u00a0gliding.</p>\n<p>She seems to understand now, she smiles a wide smile, aahing in understanding. I smile\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>I tell her my name, and she tells me hers. She extends her hand and we shake hands across the empty passage that separates our\u00a0seats.</p>\n<h3>\u2026</h3>\n<p>\u201cYou on Instagram?\u201d</p>\n<p>She says she has one Instagram of her own and one for her\u00a0dog.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what she means by telling me that, but I respond by saying that I have five accounts.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d she exclaims, leaning towards\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, here check this out,\u201d and I angle my phone towards her, showing her my account tray. \u201cI have two accounts for cars, one of my own, one for travelling and one that\u2019s about animals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes spark up at my animal account. I think this conversation\u2019s going somewhere.</p>\n<p>I gesture that I\u2019m coming over to sit beside\u00a0her.</p>\n<p>Her eyes are still sparkly. And I move over, ditching my huge fucking bag on my\u00a0seat.</p>\n<h3><strong>Language is never a\u00a0barrier</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever I want some one to open up, I ask them \u201cwhat\u2019s the stupidest thing you\u2019ve ever\u00a0done.\u201d</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t say it because I actually care about what they have to say, I say it because it gives me leave to tell my own crazy stories about period blood afterwards. And so I don\u2019t seem like a dick for telling them sensitive information from the get go.

This is for\u00a0me.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Milan, Italy</strong></p>\n<p>I sit in the bus. Still slightly buzzed from the Scottish liquor I had chugged down the night\u00a0before.</p>\n<p>I have to reach the airport in an hour and I have no idea which terminal I need to be\u00a0at.</p>\n<p>But I feel so good, this day marks my first ever day travelling solo, and my mouth is stretched upwards into a weird\u00a0smile.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no one beside me, I\u2019m in the bus early. But I hope no one sits next to me because I\u2019ve got this huge fucking backpack that I\u2019ve got resting on my\u00a0lap.</p>\n<p>The bag is too big to fit in the leg space in front of my seat so I have no choice but to put it on my lap, and I wouldn\u2019t put the bag beside me of course, because that would block a seat and I\u2019m supposed to be a nice\u00a0guy.</p>\n<p>Another passenger hops onto the bus and takes a seat parallel to mine. There\u2019s no one sitting beside her. She looks towards me and smiles politely, I smile back politely\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>I look around the bus, no one seems particularly interested in making conversation. So, I take out my trusted Mi earphones and plug them in. My favourite song is Odesza\u2019s \u2018A moment apart\u2019, it was the intro of an RSD video that I thought was really inspiring.</p>\n<p>I drift into the music, and what would seem ordinary, now looks more interesting that I\u2019ve got a beat going on in my\u00a0head.</p>\n<p>The girl parallel to me is eating a chocolate now, it seems like a fancy brand of some sort, because the chocolate has one of those long wide wrappers that you have to pull down before breaking off a thin\u00a0piece.</p>\n<p>I smile at her politely, I swear this is completely platonic, I can\u2019t stop myself from smiling when I meet someone\u2019s eye. It would be rude not\u00a0too.</p>\n<p>She offers me a chocolate. I say\u00a0sure.</p>\n<p>I eat the chocolate and ask her where she\u2019s\u00a0headed.</p>\n<p>She says that she\u2019s taking a flight to Colombia.</p>\n<p>The name of the country spurs me into a conversation.</p>\n<p>\u201cColombia huh? That\u2019s cool. El plata or el pomo,\u201d I say and wink at her, making a gun with my hands and pointing it at\u00a0her.</p>\n<p>She laughs. I don\u2019t blame her. I think it\u2019s a great conversation starter.</p>\n<p>I tell her that I\u2019m going to Barcelona. And that I had just come from Switzerland after doing paragliding.</p>\n<p>She doesn\u2019t understand what paragliding is apparently, because her face shows no recognition of sort. So I notion. I prop up my knee and run my fingers off it, then I gesture with my hands, extending them wide and swaying them as if to say I\u2019m\u00a0gliding.</p>\n<p>She seems to understand now, she smiles a wide smile, aahing in understanding. I smile\u00a0back.</p>\n<p>I tell her my name, and she tells me hers. She extends her hand and we shake hands across the empty passage that separates our\u00a0seats.</p>\n<h3>\u2026</h3>\n<p>\u201cYou on Instagram?\u201d</p>\n<p>She says she has one Instagram of her own and one for her\u00a0dog.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what she means by telling me that, but I respond by saying that I have five accounts.</p>\n<p>\u201cReally?\u201d she exclaims, leaning towards\u00a0me.</p>\n<p>\u201cYep, here check this out,\u201d and I angle my phone towards her, showing her my account tray. \u201cI have two accounts for cars, one of my own, one for travelling and one that\u2019s about animals.\u201d</p>\n<p>Her eyes spark up at my animal account. I think this conversation\u2019s going somewhere.</p>\n<p>I gesture that I\u2019m coming over to sit beside\u00a0her.</p>\n<p>Her eyes are still sparkly.

My eyes narrowed and focused, and it was as if every single part of my stiff body was channeling an inner anger. \u201cYou think I was <strong><em>disrespecting </em></strong>you?
